## ENGLISH TUTOR

I taught as an english tutor for international kids

It was in my junior year of high school

It helped me to strengthen my communication as i used to teach the students

Watch my students improve their english day after another which made me feel rewarding

Something that i didn't like was that i had to balance my student life as well as being a tutor

Grade- A It could have gone better
