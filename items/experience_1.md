## EVENT ORGANISER

I worked as a event organizer in a school talent show

This took place in my senior year of high school

I learned a lot from it like planning, scheduling time, unexpected circumstances etc

my favorite thing about the event would be me watching all my friends participate in the event as it took place smoothly and witness all the hard work i put in together

Something which i didn't like was that i had to manage all the planning scheduling as well as my classes and assignmnets all together

Grade- B for the most part enjoyable
