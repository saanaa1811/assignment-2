## DANCING CLUB

Joining my high school dancing club

This was after the covid years

Since i love dancing , it was amazing to learn new dance moves

Favorite memory would be that we were invited to perform on stage for a very popular celebrities show

Something i didn't enjoy was that as long as it seemed exciting it was also tiring because we had multiple times of practice

Grade- B for the most part enjoyable
