## INTERNSHIP IN ASUS

I worked as an paid internship in the gaming brand ASUS

This was like 2 years ago

I gained a lot of experience and knowledge in the sales, production, and retail part

My favorite memory was when i gave out my idea for marketing and all the other senior employees were amazed by it

Some of my morning tasks were repetitive which i used to find them boring

Grade- A couldn't be better
