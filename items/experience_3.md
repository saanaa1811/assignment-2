## SALES WOMEN

I worked as a part time sales women helping customer, taking care of the cash register 

I worked her 8 months ago

I developed my customer service skills

The favorite part would be then when i used to successfully help the customers the in return used to say a simple thank you which made my days

The thing i didn't enjoy was standing there long hours and hours

Grade- B for the most part enjoyable
